"Can't Believe It's Not Deer - A Game About A Moose"

A game about a moose that is attempting to break into the shack you are hiding in.
You, the player, will have to search around the shack for anything useful in order to discover the code needed to unlock the door that will lead to freedom from the moose.
This all while you try to monitor the moose using trail cameras and prevent it from making it inside your poorly defended shelter by blocking the door with old wardrobes.
